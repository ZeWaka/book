<h1>The Dream Maker</h1>
<h3>A community led "fork" of the Dantom original!</h3>
<hr>
<h2>Project Goal</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to provide a version of the BYOND Guide that is kept up to date by the community</p>
<hr>
<h4>Compiling</h4>
<p>To compile this into an ebook simply zip the root folder and change .zip to .epub</p>
<h4>Converting</h4>
<p>To convert this to your desired filetype (assuming you don't want epub) you can use an online epub converter, or Calibre, a free and open source tool for reading and managing your ebooks.</p>
