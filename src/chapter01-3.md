# Help is on the way!

No programming environment is complete without a comprehensive, accessible
reference.  Dream Maker provides this in the form of a searchable index of
topics and built-in properties.  You may access this by selecting
**Help On...** in the menu, or by hitting the **F1** key.  If the
cursor is positioned on a word (such as "`locate`"), help will be
found for that topic.
