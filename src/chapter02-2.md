# Compilation Errors

While we are on the subject of mistakes, you may as well make one now on
purpose so you know what is going on later when it's not on purpose.  Remove
one of the braces from the above code and try compiling it.  You should get
a compilation error.  If you double-click on it, the cursor will jump to the
line in the code where the compiler ran into trouble.  You can correct the
problem and then try recompiling.

Often, you will need to think less like a human and more like a machine to
see what is wrong.  Forget about what the code is trying to do and focus
more on its form: the grammar, the spelling, and little fussy details that
only a computer would care about.

The more frequently you compile your code, the less trouble you will have in
locating problems.  Also realize that if there are many compilation errors,
some of the later ones may just be confusion caused by earlier ones.  Try
fixing the first few and recompiling if the rest don't make any sense.
