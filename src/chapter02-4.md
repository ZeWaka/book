# Code Comments

When you start writing code as confusing and tangled as the last example, it
would be a good idea to leave a few clues behind.  Otherwise you may find it
incomprehensible the next time you visit, a rather embarrassing situation.
There are two ways to write comments in the code.  One is for multi-line
comments and the other is for single line ones.  Example:

	/*
	  This is a multi-line comment.
	  You can put whatever you want inside of it.
	  The compiler just skips right over.
	  Some of you may recognize it as a C style comment.
	*/

\

	//This is a single-line comment.
	//Some people know of it as the C++ style comment.

Comments can occur anywhere in the code at the end of lines, on lines by
themselves, or wherever.  They are often used to make statements of intent
or purpose.  It frequently takes only a very short note to make code much
easier to read.
